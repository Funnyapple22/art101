            Some problems I had with assigment was understanding the directions
            for this assignment since they were a little too long and
            convoluted. I also couldnt find a partner for the assignment because
            I didnt realise it was due on friday instead of monday.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I though the assignment was very useful for learning how to add
            links to other files and photos useful.

            My name is Allon and I love basketball, building planes, and making
            deals with the devil. The other week, I made a deal with him to
            bleach my hair blonde. And you know what? it actually happened. I
            now have blonde hair. Also, here is a photo of me.
